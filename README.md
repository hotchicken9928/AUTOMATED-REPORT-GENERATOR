## This program is developed in python language and with the use of libraries like pandas, reportlab and openpyxl. The function of this program is to read and analyze the data from the source files and then accordingly generate a PDF file of presenting the analysis.With the help of the library openpyxl we can read aswell as write excel format of files and this interacts with the help of pandas that establishes the handling of csv and excel file formats, and after the analysis is complete the pdf file which encapsultes the reading/analysis of the input, is generated with the help of fpdf2 library. The pdf thus generated will generally have the name of report.pdf. So the program is very simple and efficient in the job of analysis of files with the format of csv and excel.
